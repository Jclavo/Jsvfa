# JSVFA

*Java Static Value Flow Analysis*

This projects is an **Static Value Flow** Analyzer for programs in Java. Its development is based in rules, which were extracting from [SVF: Interprocedural Static Value-Flow Analysis in LLVM book](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2892208.2892235) 

# To do

It needs **com.android.tools:r8:8.0.40** and at the time it is not available in the repository so it needs to be set up manually

- Download **r8-8.0.40.pom** from [https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.android.tools:r8:8.0.40](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.android.tools:r8:8.0.40)
